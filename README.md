# bel

A hobby implementation of Paul Graham's [Bel](http://paulgraham.com/bel.html) programming language.

There's still a lot left to do, but if you'd like to play with what I have so far you can download a binary from the [release](https://github.com/jeremyschlatter/bel/releases/tag/v0.1.0) page.

To run this implementation from source, install [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install) and run `stack run` from the repository root.

Here are some [Advent of Code solutions](https://github.com/jeremyschlatter/bel-advent-of-code-2019) in Bel that this interpreter can execute.
