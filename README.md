# chime

A hobby implementation of Paul Graham's [Bel](http://paulgraham.com/bel.html) programming language.

It can do almost everything described in Paul Graham's [language guide](https://sep.yimg.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/bellanguage.txt?t=1570993483&) and [examples file](https://sep.yimg.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/belexamples.txt?t=1570993483&).

If you'd like to play with it you can download a binary from the [release](https://github.com/jeremyschlatter/bel/releases/tag/v0.3.0) page.

Or to run from source, install [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install) and run `stack run` from the repository root.

Here are some [Advent of Code solutions](https://github.com/jeremyschlatter/bel-advent-of-code-2019) in Bel that I developed using this interpreter.
